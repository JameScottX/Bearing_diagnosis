　　The bearing data is using [**Case Western Reserve University Bearing Data**](https://csegroups.case.edu/bearingdatacenter/pages/welcome-case-western-reserve-university-bearing-data-center-website).  
　　It's based on [**Tensorflow**](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) and be done in 2019/8/5.
